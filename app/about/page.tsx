            <p>Our primary goal is to nurture and celebrate Chinese culture and heritage. We hold two large cultural showcases annually: FullMoonFest for the Mid-Autumn festival and Chinafest for Lunar New Year. Both include dances, skits, and other entertainment, showing facets of both traditional and modern Chinese culture. We also have other cultural events like Dollar Dim Sum, where we sell Chinese food for $1 a portion. However, despite our goal to celebrate Chinese culture, we invite people from all backgrounds to join CSA!</p>

            <p>Beyond cultural celebrations, CSA prides itself on our unity and community-building. Our family system forges lifelong connections, where individuals find support, mentorship, and a sense of belonging. We foster many chances to meet friends old and new, whether through sports, parties, or other social events. We create spaces where bonds are forged and nurtured beyond cultural affiliations.</p>

            <h2 style={{marginBottom: "2%"}}>Outreach</h2>
            <p>Finally, CSA spreads our goals throughout the whole UVA community. We participate in Culturefest, UVAâ€™s annual multicultural showcase; interact and co-host events with other CIOs on grounds such as UPC and other multicultural organizations; and invite the whole UVA community to come to our events, especially for our large culture shows like FullMoonFest and Chinafest.</p>
